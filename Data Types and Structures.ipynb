        "#THEORETICAL QUESTIONS\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1. What are data structures, and why are they important?\n",
        "# Data structures are methods of organizing and managing data efficiently.\n",
        "# They help optimize performance for operations like storage, access, and modification.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.\n",
        "# Mutable data types can be changed after creation, while immutable data types cannot.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example:\n",
        "# Mutable Example:\n",
        "mutable_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "mutable_list[0] = 4  # Modifies the list\n",
        "\n",
        "# Immutable Example:\n",
        "immutable_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "# immutable_tuple[0] = 4  # Uncommenting this will raise an error\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n",
        "# Lists are mutable, allowing modifications, while tuples are immutable, ensuring data integrity.\n",
        "# Tuples are also faster than lists for iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. Describe how dictionaries store data.\n",
        "# Dictionaries use a hash table to store data in key-value pairs, enabling fast data retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "# Sets are useful when duplicate values are not allowed and when fast membership checks are needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "# Strings are sequences of characters and are immutable. Lists, on the other hand, are mutable\n",
        "# and can store elements of various data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "# Tuples are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation, preserving integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "# A hash table maps keys to values using a hash function. Dictionaries in Python are implemented\n",
        "# as hash tables, ensuring fast key-based lookups.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "# Yes, lists can contain elements of various data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n",
        "# Strings are immutable to enhance security, memory efficiency, and compatibility with hash-based operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "# Dictionaries allow fast lookups using keys and store data in a key-value format, which is intuitive for many applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n",
        "# Tuples are preferred when working with fixed data, such as geographical coordinates, where values should not be altered.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "# Sets automatically discard duplicate values, ensuring uniqueness of elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "# For lists, \"in\" checks for the presence of an element. For dictionaries, it checks for the presence of a key.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.\n",
        "# No, tuples are immutable, so their elements cannot be modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case.\n",
        "# A nested dictionary is a dictionary within another dictionary, useful for hierarchical data.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example:\n",
        "nested_dict = {\n",
        "    \"Alice\": {\"age\": 25, \"grade\": \"A\"},\n",
        "    \"Bob\": {\"age\": 23, \"grade\": \"B\"}\n",
        "}\n",
        "print(nested_dict[\"Alice\"][\"grade\"])  # Output: A\n",
        "\n",
        "# 17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n",
        "# The average time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary is O(1).\n",
        "\n",
        "# 18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "# Lists are preferred when order is important or when key-value relationships are not required.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        "# Dictionaries store elements based on hash values, not insertion order, but data retrieval is efficient via keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n",
        "# Lists use indices for retrieval, while dictionaries use keys, making dictionaries faster for specific lookups.\n",
